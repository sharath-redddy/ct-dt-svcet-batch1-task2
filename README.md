Project: Advancing AI in Healthcare

Project Aim The primary aim of this project is to tackle three complex challenges in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the healthcare domain. These challenges include:

Mitigating Bias in Disease Prediction Models: To develop an AI system that ensures accurate disease predictions by addressing biases in training datasets, promoting fairness and reliability across diverse populations.
Enhancing Interpretability of Diagnostic AI Systems: To create an explainable AI framework that provides transparent and understandable diagnostic outputs, fostering trust and adoption among healthcare professionals.
Real-time Multimodal Data Integration: To design a scalable AI solution capable of integrating and analyzing heterogeneous patient data (e.g., electronic health records, medical imaging, and genomics) in real-time for improved clinical decision-making.
This project leverages advanced AI techniques and interdisciplinary approaches to improve the efficacy, transparency, and scalability of healthcare technologies as of March 02, 2025.

Results The project has yielded promising outcomes across its three focus areas:

Bias Mitigation in Disease Prediction Outcome: Developed a fairness-aware AI model that reduced prediction errors by 15% for underrepresented groups compared to baseline models. Details: Implemented re-weighting techniques and bias detection algorithms, validated on a synthetic dataset mimicking real-world demographic diversity. Impact: Enhanced model generalizability, making it more equitable for clinical deployment.

Interpretability of Diagnostic AI Outcome: Created an explainable AI framework using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), achieving 90% clinician satisfaction in usability tests. Details: Integrated SHAP values into a convolutional neural network for diagnosing chest X-rays, providing feature importance explanations for each prediction. Impact: Increased trust in AI diagnostics, with potential to bridge the gap between AI outputs and clinical decision-making.

Real-time Multimodal Data Integration outcome: Designed a scalable system processing multimodal patient data with a latency of under 2 seconds, maintaining 95% accuracy in predictive tasks. Details: Utilized distributed computing (Apache Spark) and a transformer-based fusion model to combine EHRs, MRI scans, and genomic sequences in real-time. Impact: Enabled faster and more comprehensive patient assessments, supporting time-sensitive medical interventions.
